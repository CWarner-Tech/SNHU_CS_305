Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting firm specializing in customized financial planning services encompassing savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They asked to modernize their operations by enhancing software security, specifically requesting the implementation of secure communication protocols in their web application. This included adding a checksum verification mechanism to ensure secure data transmission, aiming to protect client data and financial information from potential breaches.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? 

Throughout this course, I learned a lot about software security. I implemented several dependency checks utilizing Spring and Maven as well as suppressed false positives. Security to a company's overall well-being is truly paramount. Without security clients and the company’s information are at risk. Crashes and breaches will affect the client's trust in the company.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Reading through and understanding the false positives as well as how the vulnerabilities could be avoided, this part of the dependency check did seem a bit more involved, and I could imagine more stressful. Figuring out what can be suppressed or what should be avoided was indeed challenging. 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Increasing Artemis software security was completed in steps, including code refactoring to enhance structure and incorporating secure coding practices, implementation of cryptographic hash algorithms for data integrity, and transitioning from HTTP to HTTPS to encrypt communications. Access controls were also secured to restrict unauthorized access. Self-signed certificates were utilized for secure transmissions. In the future, the strategy I would use automated vulnerability scanning tools for regular checks, conducting penetration testing to simulate attacks, and utilizing static and dynamic analysis tools to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities. Additionally, ongoing security audits and reviews will ensure best practices are being followed, while risk assessments will monitor mitigation efforts, ensuring robust protection of client data and sustaining trust in their financial planning services.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 

Both functionality and security post-refactoring were ensured through thorough manual testing for functionality and static analysis tools like dependency-check for detecting new vulnerabilities. Integration testing validated component interaction and security measure implementation. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Tools and practices used included static analysis tools like dependency-check for vulnerability assessment, Java Keytool for managing cryptographic keys and certificates, and adherence to secure coding guidelines to ensure robust defense against vulnerabilities. These resources not only strengthen my current project's security but also provide me with effective methods for maintaining software integrity in the future.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From my work with Artemis Financial, I would showcase to future employers my expertise in implementing secure communication protocols by converting HTTP to HTTPS, deploying cryptographic hash algorithms for data integrity, and integrating AES encryption for safeguarding sensitive information. I would present evidence of conducting thorough static and functional testing using tools like dependency-check to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensuring the refactored code's integrity and security compliance. This demonstrates my ability to enhance software security, adhere to industry standards, and deliver robust solutions that meet client needs effectively.
